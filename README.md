# sysUpTime
This tool is used to probe the sysUpTime for many devices, up to 150. Tool can probe each device every 30 sec- onds. The Tool can handle non responsive devices, and variable communication delays. The results are to be presented on a simple web dashboard. The Tool is done in such a way that its possible to get an easy overview of all the devices. If a device has failed to respond to the last message the device should be presented using a light red color (0xFFEEEE/RGB), and for each request the device misses, the colour is made more red. If a device has failed to answer more than 30 messages, the colour is red (0xFF0000/RGB). If a device responds to a message the color is normalized to white (0xFFFFFF). On the dashboard we can completely identify the device, and the device is clickable and is done using java script, that brings up detailed information about that particular device, i.e. the device last reported uptime, number of sent requests, number of lost requests and when this information was updated (web server time).
